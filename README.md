# dataset-creation-ChatGPT

So, I was following this guy on youtube to do a portfolio project. It was going well until the time when the necessity of the dataset arrives. The guy wants money for the dataset. But I don't want to pay, so I used chatGPT to make a dataset with all the necessary fields in it. And it works well except for the datetime datatype. Somehow that's the only thing that's not working. Still figuring it out. If you have any idea kindly ping me on tharunprabu2418@gmail.com
